# Linux hunting
## Start with network connections and go from there

#### List open files:
`lsof -i -P`

#### find network connections
`lsof -p <processID>`

#### List processes WITH the command line that launched them
`ps aux`

#### If you find a suspicious process, you can cd to that pid and then use strings to examine the files
`cd /proc/[pid]`
`ls`
`strings ./<file> | less`

#### Find all files associated with listener
`cd /proc/<processID>`
`strings ./<file>`

#### If lots of noise, choose a minimum length of maybe 6? Warning: might not see important other short strings.
`strings -n 6 malware.exe > output.txt`
Google errors that you find

#### List open file, show files unlinked/deleted, you can still see it in /proc/<processID>
`lsof +L1`

#### records the source IP, destination IP, and other information of a TCP connection in the ESTABLISHED state
`/proc/net/nf_conntrack | less`
